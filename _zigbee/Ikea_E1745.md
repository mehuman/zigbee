### Pairing
Pair the sensor by pressing the pair button 5 times in a row.
The red light on the front side should flash a few times, and then the LED will start pulsating and the sensor is in pairing mode.
When connected, the light turns off.

Some older versions of this device might use a 10-sec-press-and-hold to get into pairing mode.
### Reset
Reset the sensor by pressing the pair button 4 times in a row. Wait till the LED confirms it.
