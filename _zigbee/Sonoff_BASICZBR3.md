### Pairing
If brand new, when powered on it will attempt to pair to the coordinator automatically. If not (or if has been paired before and needs to be re-paired) - press and hold the (relay) button on the top for about 5 seconds until the relay cliks and the red LED flashes several times. The device will then go into pairing mode and the blue LED will begin to flash. When connected, the blue LED will turn on solid. It should then be connected. Pressing the button should activate the relay on/off as normal, and the red LED will be on/off. 

### DIN rail mount
