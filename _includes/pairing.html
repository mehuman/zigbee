  Factory reset the light bulb (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npxOrPxVfe0">video instructions</a> [video]).  After resetting the bulb will automatically connect.
  <p>
  While pairing, keep the bulb close to the Zigbee gateway.
  <p>
  What works is to use (very) short “on”’s and a little bit longer “off’s”.
  Start with bulb on, then off, and then 6 “on’s”, where you kill the light as soon as the bulb shows signs of turning on.
  <p>
